[Peter Neish](https://twitter.com/peterneish) and I taught a one-day 
[Library Carpentry workshop](https://weaverbel.github.io/2018-05-04-unimelb-lc/) to around 24 library staff at the 
University of Melbourne on 4 May.

We covered jargon busting, regular expressions for pattern matching, the Unix shell, and OpenRefine.

Peter got his first chance to teach when he ran the regular expressions session before lunch. 
I taught the rest with help from Peter,
[Lyle Winton](https://twitter.com/lylewinton) and [Alistair Walsh](https://twitter.com/alistairwalsh). 

We has a few snafus wth unco-operative shells and site workarounds, but on the whole, the day went well.

Here are the happy campers!
