I'm happy to announce the members of the inaugural Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee:

- Carmi Cronje, CSIRO, Australia
- Katrin Leinweber, TIB Hannover, Germany
- Mark Laufersweiler, University of Oklahoma, USA
- Tim Dennis, UCLA, USA
- Erika Mias, University of Toronto, Canada
- Chris Erdmann, CDL/The Carpentries, USA (ex officio, logistics)

The Carpentries Handbook provides a 
[description](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/lesson_development_roles.html#curriculum-advisory-committee) 
of the philosophy guiding the Committee and the responsibilities of Curriculum Advisors. At our first meeting, we will scope 
out our next steps.

In the meantime, I wanted to welcome Carmi, Katrin, Mark, Tim, and Erika and thank them for taking on this important role. 

### About the Committee:

#### Carmi Cronje

Thank you for this opportunity! I'm interested in learning more about training needs in Australia, keeping in touch with new tech/skills required to meet those needs, and working with the committee to evaluate which can be put in the pipeline for future lesson development. Supporting and fostering communication between lesson maintainers to optimise processes for the community to contribute to lesson development is also a priority.
