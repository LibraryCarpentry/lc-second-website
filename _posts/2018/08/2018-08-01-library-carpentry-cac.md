I'm happy to announce the members of the inaugural Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee:

The Carpentries Handbook provides a 
[description](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/lesson_development_roles.html#curriculum-advisory-committee) 
of the philosophy guiding the Committee and the responsibilities of Curriculum Advisors. At our first meeting, we will scope 
out our next steps.

In the meantime, I wanted to welcome Carmi, Katrin, Mark, Tim, and Erika and thank them for taking on this important role. 

### About the Committee:

#### Carmi Cronje

I'm interested in learning about the Library Carpentry community's needs in Australia, keeping in tune with new tech 
developments and working with CAC to evaluate which can be put in the pipeline for future lesson development. 
Supporting and fostering communication between lesson maintainers to optimise processes for the 
community to contribute to lesson development is also a priority.

#### Katrin Leinweber

#### Mark Laufersweiler
I have been active with Carpentries for nearly 6 years as a learner, helper, instructor, and Trainer. When changing jobs from meteorology to work at the OU Libraries as the Research Data Specialist, I helped to make the library the focal point for Carpentries as part of our outreach for researchers and better research data management practices. I look forward to facilitating curriculum development for instructing library staff to promote computing skills that will help with changing roles and duties in libraries.

#### Erika Mias
The first Carpentries workshop I attended was a Library Carpentry one in 2015: The curriculum has adapted and expanded so much since then and I am pleased to have this chance to give back to the LC community in a new way by working on the CAC. Since 2015 I've been a helper at and instructor at several workshops and worked with collegues to adapt LC lesson material for special training within a univerity library. I've served on the African Task force since 2017, worked as a collections manager in natural history collections, a digital curation officer in a university library and also worked as an admin for African Carpentries.
