I'm happy to announce the members of the inaugural Library Carpentry Curriculum Advisory Committee:

- Carmi Cronje, CSIRO, Australia
- Katrin Leinweber, TIB Hannover, Germany
- Mark Laufersweiler, University of Oklahoma, USA
- Tim Dennis, UCLA, USA
- Erika Mias, University of Toronto, Canada
- Chris Erdmann, CDL/The Carpentries, USA (ex officio, logistics)

The Carpentries Handbook provides a 
[description](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/lesson_development/lesson_development_roles.html#curriculum-advisory-committee) 
of the philosophy guiding the Committee and the responsibilities of Curriculum Advisors. At our first meeting, we will scope 
out our next steps.

In the meantime, I wanted to welcome Carmi, Katrin, Mark, Tim, and Erika and thank them for taking on this important role. 

### About the Committee:

#### Carmi Cronje

I'm interested in learning about the Library Carpentry community's needs in Australia, keeping in tune with new tech 
developments and working with CAC to evaluate which can be put in the pipeline for future lesson development. 
Supporting and fostering communication between lesson maintainers to optimise processes for the 
community to contribute to lesson development is also a priority.
