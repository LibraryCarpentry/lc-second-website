Seventy Library Carpentry workshops have now been taught around the world, including one-day and two-day events, with future workshops being added every day.

With this milestone behind us, it is important to pause and appreciate what has been achieved so far by the community. Since 2015, more than 99 instructors and 121 helpers, 220 in total, have contributed to Library Carpentry training events in 13 countries. We have collaboratively developed open educational lessons to teach software and data skills for anyone who works in libraries or similar organizations.

Thanks to their contributions, we’ve helped well over one-thousand learners covering a range of topics, from Introduction to Data to Open Refine ([see the full list of lessons](https://librarycarpentry.org/#portfolio)). Fourteen lesson maintainers keep the lessons running smoothly and make sure that they conform to the Carpentry’s pedagogical model. In addition, we have had two highly successful sprints that featured a global set of lesson developers working to add and improve to Library Carpentry lesson materials (more on the sprints below). 

There is still much more event data that we can capture from our community! If you see anything that is missing, please contribute to the [workshops spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ekCHTBRtTO0vAWIq8YER49ZLwh18PYPGbgJtZ5V9rgw/edit#gid=1110089093) and/or reach out to chris@carpentries.org. 

### Funding support


Library Carpentry workshops have benefited from the generous support of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/), the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://www.software.ac.uk), the [National and State Libraries of Australia](https://www.nsla.org.au/) (NSLA), the [California Digital Library](https://www.cdlib.org/), the [Institute of Museum and Library Services](https://www.imls.gov/), [City University London](https://www.city.ac.uk/), the [University of Sussex](https://www.sussex.ac.uk/), and [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/).


### Workshops by year and key highlights

| Year | Number of Workshops |
| :------------- |--------:|
| 2013 | 1 | 
| 2014 | 5 | 
| 2015 | 2 | 
| 2016 | 18 |

In 2017, the first Library Carpentry-Mozilla Sprint (or #mozsprint) was held,
where more than 105 people from seven countries worked on upgrading and creating lessons. It was also the year when an instructor training targeted at library professionals  was run after [csv,conf](https://csvconf.com/) in Portland, Oregon. 

In 2018, the second Library Carpentry-Mozilla Sprint generated 3,138 views of the repositories during the sprint, with 341 unique visitors. More than 150 pull requests and issues were raised against the lessons, with the git and sql lessons getting some much-needed attention. A second instructor training geared towards librarians is planned for late August 

Thanks to community involved in developing the lessons and more instructors coming on board, workshops are on the rise. With the [appointment of Chris Erdmann](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/04/announce-ce-lc-hire/) as the Library Carpentry Community and Development Director. Chris aims to inspire further community growth, instructor onboarding, lesson development, and to help with logistics during Library Carpentry’s incubation.

### Growing the instructor pool

Another dedicated Carpentries instructor training for libraries will be run in Calgary from 30-31 August. 
[Read more](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2018/06/26/library-carpentry-inst-training/). This will help grow the community of instructors to allow Library Carpentry to respond to more requests for workshops.

### What has been taught

OpeRefine, Unix Shell, regular expressions, Python, Git, these are all Library Carpentry lessons that have been taught the most. Instructors value flexibility and SQL, Tidy Data, Web Scraping, and Data Intro for Archivists have also found their way into instruction, but far less than the more popular lessons above.

### In the beginning

Library Carpentry was the brainchild of [Dr. James Baker](https://twitter.com/j_w_baker), (then at the British Library, now at the University of Sussex), who came up with the idea of adapting Software Carpentry lessons and teaching methods to teach librarians digital skills (based on the popularity of earlier Software Carpentry workshops for librarians run at Harvard University, University Toronto, Edmonton Public Library, New York Public Library, and West Vancouver Memorial Library). Along with Daniel van Strien and Owen Stephens, James ran the first Library Carpentry workshop in London in November 2015. The course was taught in four evening sessions over four week, and James's work on this was supported by a fellowship with the [Software Sustainability Institute](https://software.ac.uk/). 

The [2016 Library Carpentry two-day sprint](https://software-carpentry.org/blog/2016/06/library-carpentry-sprint.html) saw twenty people from six countries work on the lessons and begin to build a global community.

In 2016, Library Carpentry won the British Library Labs Teaching and Learning Award.
