Fifty-six Library Carpentry workshops have now been taught around the world, with another six in the pipeline for later in 
2018 and 2019.

Of the 56, 23 were single day 'express' workshops which generally covered an introduction to data, (jargon busting, 
file structures and regular expressions), task automation using the shell, and [OpenRefine](https://openrefine.org) for data cleanup.

Australia is currently out in front with 22 workshops taught, while the USA is second with 11, 
and the UK not far behind on nine. Europe is well represented with workshops in Norway, Denmark, Germany, 
Switzerland, and Italy. New Zealand is currently at four, but more are planned, and the three in 
South Africa should soon tick over to four. 

| Country | Number of workshops |
| :------------- |--------:|
| Australia | 22 | 
| USA | 11 | 
| UK | 9 | 
| NZ | 4 |
| South Africa | 3 |
| Norway | 2 |
| Germany | 1 |
| Canada | 1 |
| Denmark | 1 |
| Italy | 1 |
| Switzerland | 1 |
| TOTAL | 56 |

Australian workshop numbers have been augmented by the [National and State Libraries of Australia](https://www.nsla.org.au/) (NSLA),
who funded an Australian
capital cities roadshow taught by Belinda Weaver in 2017. [Universities New Zealand](https://www.universitiesnz.ac.nz/) 
have also kicked in funding, 
supporting the recent [Library Carpentry New Zealand roadshow for academic 
libraries](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2018/07/18/lc-nz-roadshow/). 

### Workshops by year

| Year | Number of Workshops |
| :------------- |--------:|
| 2015 | 1 | 
| 2016 | 18 | 
| 2017 | 25 | 
| 2018 | 12 | 
| TOTAL | 56 |

2017 saw the largest number of workshops taught, with 25. This is possibly down to the impact of the 2017 sprint,
where more than 100 people from seven countries worked on upgrading lessons. It was also the year when an 
instructor training targeted at library staff was run as a tie-in to [csv,conf](https://csvconf.com/) in Portland, Oregon. 
Many of the instructors taught there have gone on to run and teach at their own Library Carpentry workshops. 

Workshop numbers in the US are already on the rise with the 
[appointment of Chris Erdmann](https://carpentries.org/blog/2018/04/announce-ce-lc-hire/) as the Library Carpentry Community 
and Development Director. Chris aims to get a lot more workshops going over the next couple of years. 

### Growing the instructor pool

Another dedicated instructor training targeted at library staff will be run in Calgary from 30-31 August. 
[Read more](https://librarycarpentry.org/blog/2018/06/26/library-carpentry-inst-training/). This should 
help drive up the number of workshops run in the US and Canada. 

### What has been taught

OpenRefine has been by far the most popular lesson, with the shell not far behind. Regular expressions have been covered 
in a bit less than half the workshops, while Git and Python have been taught much less often.  

| Lessons | Number of times taught |
| :------------- |--------:|
| OpenRefine | 33 | 
| Shell | 31 |
| Regex | 22 | 
| Python | 10 | 
| Git | 9 | 
| SQL | 4 |
| Tidy data | 2 |
| Web scraping | 1 |

### In the beginning

Library Carpentry was the brainchild of [Dr. James Baker](https://twitter.com/j_w_baker), (then at the British Library, 
now at the University of Sussex), who came up with the idea of adapting Software Carpentry lessons and teaching methods 
to teach librarians digital skills. Along with Daniel van Strien and Owen Stephens, James ran the first Library Carpentry 
workshop in London in November 2015. The course was taught in four evening sessions over four weeks.
